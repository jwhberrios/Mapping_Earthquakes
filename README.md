# Mapping Earthquakes
##### Using HTML, JavaScript, Leaflet library, and mapbox.
Earthquake data retrieved from the USGS was visually presented on a map using HTML and JavaScript code. The maps were styled using the Leaflet library and Mapbox. A 7 day earthquake occurence was visually presented on a map with pop up markers whose radius represented the magnitude of the earthquake ranging from 1 through 5. 

Another map was created presenting the occurence of earthquakes relative to the location of the tectonic plates.
A third map was created using the navigation dark style provided by Mapbox.
